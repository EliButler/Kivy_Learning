Pycharm 2017.3.7
Interpreter 3.6 (ven 4)

The purpose of this code is to learn and test the Kivy GUI framework.

First try and no luck.
I even downloaded the two dependencies:
kivy_deps
kivy_deps.sdl2
And:
gstreamer
glew
sdl2

Use this verbatim to run an app:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()
